### Hello! Thank you for using the FNF Note Randomizer! Before you begin using this I have a couple things to say.

## First, this MUST be extracted from the .zip file to work!

Second, make sure to read OPTIONS.txt! It has descriptions for all of the options that you can find in the options menu because
without proper context it can be hard to understand what some of the options mean. If you are a past user of the note randomizer
and want to see what all has changed, or you're just curious, please check the changelog!

Lastly, when using the randomizer setup menu, keep in mind that it often doesn't work well with start of song cutscenes. Same goes
with the save chart prompt and end of song cutscenes, just to a lesser extent.

Other than that, you should be good to go! There will be a to-do list below on things that I'd like to do with the randomizer
in the future, but that does not guarantee that I can do those things or that they will be done soon.

Also, I really haven't used Github too much and don't fully know what I'm doing so if you end up making a pull request or something then
please keep that in mind!

## TO-DO:

-Make the new Github repo prettier lol

-Make the randomizer setup menu more compatible with start of song cutscenes (if possible)

-Make the save chart prompt more compatible with end of song cutscenes (if possible)

-Add notetype randomization

-Fix the wonky text centering in the typing system

-improve the pattern recognition a little more to better recognize all of the notes in doubles and triples

-There is this one random ass double in Philly Nice Nightmare that true random seems to stack constantly and I don't know if this
is actually an issue because I haven't seen true random stack on literally any other song but it is bothering me
