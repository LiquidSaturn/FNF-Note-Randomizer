This file is to explain what the options mean, if you're just looking to use the randomizer and don't really wanna tinker around too much then this isn't a necessary read.


Auto Activate - Automatically activates the note randomizer with the current settings when entering PlayState

Debug - Traces a bunch of the inner "thoughts" of the randomizer while it's generating a chart, good to use when testing or making randomizer presets


Prompts

Setup SubState - Opens a substate whenever entering PlayState that lets you select whether or not you wanna use the randomizer alongside several other options (overwrites Auto Activate and True Random Directions if set to true)

Save Chart Prompt - If enabled, the game will open a prompt asking you if you want to save the random chart just generated whenever you finish a song


True Random

True Random Directions - If enabled, makes the randomizer stop giving a fuck about what is "user-friendly" and gives you the most raw, undercooked sewage you could ever ask for

Note Stacking - Whether or not True Random Directions is allowed to stack multiple notes directly on top of each other in the same spot


Note Queue

Max Note Queue Length - The maximum length that the note queue (a mapping of notes that the game is temporarily not allowed to generate) is allowed to be, if set to a negative number, subtracts the value from the amount of strum notes each character has

Note Queue Time - The amount of time that a note is put in the note queue for after being generated

Note Queue Time (Doubles) - The amount of time that notes in doubles are put in the note queue for after being generated

Note Queue Time (Triples) - The amount of time that notes in triples are put in the note queue for after being generated


Note Bias

Note Bias Increase - How much the likelihood of a note being allowed the possibility to generate will be INCREASED each time it is NOT generated

Note Bias Decrease - How much the likelihood of a note being allowed the possibility to generate will be DECREASED each time it IS generated


Note Pattern Limits

Max Notes In Jack - The maximum amount of notes allowed in a jack (one note being pressed repeatedly), if set to a value less than 1, completely uncaps

Max Notes In Trill - The maximum amount of notes allowed in a trill (two notes being pressed back and forth repeatedly), if set to a value less than 2, completely uncaps

Max Notes in Wave - The maximum amount of notes allowed in a wave (three notes being pressed in a pattern repeatedly), if set to a value less than 3, completely uncaps

Max Notes in Crossover - The maximum amount of notes allowed in a crossover (three notes being pressed in the order of 1-2-3-2 repeatedly), if set to a value less than 4, completely uncaps


Pattern Odds

Odds of Jack - The chance (0-1) for a jack to be allowed the possibility of continuing by the randomizer (if the cap has not been reached)

Odds of Trill - The chance (0-1) for a trill to be allowed the possibility of continuing by the randomizer (if the cap has not been reached)

Odds of Wave - The chance (0-1) for a wave to be allowed the possibility of continuing by the randomizer (if the cap has not been reached)

Odds of Crossover - The chance (0-1) for a crossover to be allowed the possibility of continuing by the randomizer (if the cap has not been reached)


Diminishing Pattern Odds

Diminishing Odds of Jack - The amount (0-1) that Odds of Jack will decrease for each successive note in the jack

Diminishing Odds of Trill - The amount (0-1) that Odds of Trill will decrease for each successive note in the trill

Diminishing Odds of Wave - The amount (0-1) that Odds of Wave will decrease for each successive note in the wave

Diminishing Odds of Crossover - The amount (0-1) that Odds of Crossover will decrease for each successive note in the crossover

CAREFUL!!!

Reset Save - Resets your note randomizer save, does not include chart saves
